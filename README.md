### Labs and Exercises
- [Exercise 1](ex1.java): [Math and Scanner](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTUwMzY4NDI1/a/MTkzNTcyNjQ4/details)
  - Write a program that displays a random number from 1 to 10, then ask for a number to be input. Evaluate the two numbers and display the product of them. For example, if the random number is 6 and the number input (SCANNED) is 10 then the answer displayed is 60
- [Exercise 2](ex2.java): [Scanner, Math.Min + Max](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTUwMzY4NDI1/a/MTk0NDE0NTI2/details)
  - Read in a series of 5 numbers
Display the largest of the numbers
Display the smallest of the numbers
Display the average of the 5 numbers
Display the SQUARE ROOT of the sum of all 5 numbers
- [Exercise 2 Part 2](ex2-part2.java): Instead of reading in 5 numbers, the user decides how many numbers he/she wants to input. Do the same calculations for all of the numbers inputed.
- [Exercise 3](ex3.java): [No Scanner or println - JOptionPane](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTUwMzY4NDI1/a/MTc0NTAwNjE2/details)
  - Without using the Scanner class, examine the Java API and write a program that takes in a Players Name as well as their 3 Golf Scores, then determine and display (without using System.out.println) their AVERAGE Score.
- [Exercise 4](ex4.java): [Over 18](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTUwMzY4NDI1/a/MTc1MTY2NTc4/details)
  - You can use JoptionPane or Scanner to do the following: Read in a person's FIRST NAME , BIRTHDAY(MONTH AND YEAR).

Diaplay a result, for Example if they enter SallyJoeBob 09 2000 you display: SallyJoeBob, you are NOT over 18 years old
- [Exercise 5](ex5.java): [Examine](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTUwMzY4NDI1/a/MjQxMjg1MzIy/details)
  - Read in a String and determine the following: TOTAL number of letters, If it starts with a Vowel, Total number of numbers in the string. EX? Apple123 8 letters, YES, 3
- [Exercise 6](ex6.java): [Exact Age Calculator](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTUwMzY4NDI1/a/MjU3NTQ0NTQw/details)
  - Accept a month day and year of birth. Get the current date and determine a persons full age as in YEARS plus days old. Ex., if a person was born on 9-26-2000 and it is currently 9-27-2015 that person is 14 years and 364 days old.
